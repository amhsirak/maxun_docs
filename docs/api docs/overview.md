Maxun provides the feature to convert Website to API by allowing the user to get data extracted by the robot or to run a robot via an API call. The Website to API feature can be used as follows:

### 1. Generate API Key
In order to run the API routes the user needs to first generate an API key. This can be done by clicking the **Generate API Key** button present on the **API Key** section of the sidebar. The generated key can be copied, viewed or deleted.

### 2. Authorize 
The user can navigate to the API Docs page by clicking on the Website to API section of the sidebar. In order to run the API, the user must first enter the API key by clicking on Authorize. This will authorize the user to run the API endpoints.

### 3. Try Out 
After successful authorization, the user can proceed to try out the API endpoint. By clicking on the **Try it out** button present within each route. Depending on the route, it might require paramters for execution.

The routes to execute a robot run via an API call or to get information about the robot can be further segregated into two types:

1. [Robot Routes](./robots.md)

2. [Run Routes](./runs.md)
