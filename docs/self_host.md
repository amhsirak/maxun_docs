# Self-Hosting Maxun

Maxun can be fully self-hosted using a **Docker** setup, with a **reverse proxy** configuration managed via [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/).

Weâ€™ve created a detailed, step-by-step guide that walks you through:

- Setting up **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- Deploying Maxun services
- Configuring **NGINX** as a reverse proxy for HTTPS, security headers, and compression
