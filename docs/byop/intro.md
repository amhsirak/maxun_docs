# BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy)

Maxun provides a feature called BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy), designed to give users greater control over their data extraction activities. With BYOP, you can connect your own proxies to Maxun, enabling:

1. Location-Specific Scraping: Access data specific to certain geographical regions.
2. Geo-Restricted Data Access: Overcome restrictions on location-based content.
3. Enhanced Security: Keep all proxy configurations secure on your self-hosted platform.

### Availability

This feature is available **exclusively for the self-hosted version of Maxun**. For cloud users, Maxun manages all anti-bot infrastructure, ensuring reliable scraping without requiring additional proxy setup.

### Proxy Configuration

HTTP and SOCKS proxies are supported. Currently, proxies are configured per user rather than per robot. However, support for per robot proxy configuration is coming soon, offering even more granular control over your scraping workflows.

### Authenticated Proxies
