# Airtable

## Overview

Airtable integration allows you to automatically sync the data extracted by your robot directly into an Airtable Base. Whenever the robot completes a successful run, the captured data is appended to your designated Airtable Base, enabling seamless and real-time data management.


## Key Features

1. Automatic Data Syncing: Every successful robot run appends the captured data directly to your Airtable base.
2. Effortless Data Management: Keep all your extracted data organized in a single Airtable base for easy access and sharing.
3. Real-Time Updates: As soon as a run is complete, the data appears in your Airtable base.

## Important Note

The data extracted before integrating with Airtable will not be synced in the Airtable Base. Only the data extracted after the integration will be synced.
