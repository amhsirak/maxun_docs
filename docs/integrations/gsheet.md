# Google Sheet

## Overview

Google Sheets integration allows you to automatically sync the data extracted by your robot directly into a Google Sheet. Whenever the robot completes a successful run, the captured data is appended to your designated Google Sheet, enabling seamless and real-time data management.

## Key Features

1. Automatic Data Syncing: Every successful robot run appends the captured data directly to your Google Sheet.
2. Effortless Data Management: Keep all your extracted data organized in a single Google Sheet for easy access and sharing.
3. Real-Time Updates: As soon as a run is complete, the data appears in your Google Sheet.

## Important Note

The data extracted before integrating with Google Sheets will not be synced in the Google Sheet. Only the data extracted after the integration will be synced.
