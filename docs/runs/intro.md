Robot runs are the core functionality of Maxun robots. Each run represents a complete cycle where the robot performs its tasks based on the configuration and training provided by the user at the time of robot creation. A successful run contains all the extracted data, fulfilling the primary objective of the robot.


## Key Features

## 1. Execution Options

Robot runs can be initiated in three different ways:

**1. Manual Runs**: Users can run a robot directly from Maxun dashboard.

**2. Scheduled Runs**: Automate runs by scheduling them to execute at specific times or intervals. 

**3. API Runs**: Trigger runs programmatically via API calls, enabling integration with external systems.

## 2. Exporting Results

Once a run is complete, the extracted data can be exported in the following formats:
**1. CSV**: For easy viewing and compatibility with spreadsheet software.

**2. JSON**: For seamless integration with other applications and systems that utilize structured data.

**3. Markdown**: (Coming Soon)
