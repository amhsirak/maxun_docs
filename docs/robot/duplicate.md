Robot duplication is useful to extract data from pages with the <b>same structure without training a new robot!</b>

### When to duplicate a robot?
1. The new page has the same structure as the existing page.
2. You want to extract the same data as the existing page.

Example: If you've created a robot for <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/topics/chrome-extensions">producthunt.com/topics/chrome-extensions</a>, you can duplicate it to scrape similar pages like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/topics/sports">producthunt.com/topics/sports</a> without training a robot from scratch.

Using robot duplication, you can bulk extract same data from thousands of pages of the same website, without writing code.
