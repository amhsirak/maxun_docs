Maxun robots are automated tools that help you collect data from websites without writing any code. Think of them as your personal web assistants that can navigate websites, extract information, and organize data just like you would manually - but faster and more efficiently.

## What Can A Robot Do?
1. Gather web data without writing a single line of code - just point, click, and collect
2. Handle infinite scrolling and pagination
3. Auto-adapt to website layout changes (coming soon)
4. Run on a specific schedule
5. Run via APIs for third-party integrations
6. Extract data behind login. 2FA/MFA support soon!
7. Integrate with your favorite applications. Google Sheet supported for now - more integrations coming soon!
