Depending on the use-case, a robot should be configured to perform any of the following actions.

### 1. Capture List
Capture List should be used to capture bulk data. Example: Extract products from <a href="https://producthunt.com">producthunt.com</a>. Capture List involves three steps:
1. Select the product/item to capture.
2. Select fields inside the selected product/item.
3. Show the robot how to handle pagination.
4. Set a limit, i.e number of items to capture.
