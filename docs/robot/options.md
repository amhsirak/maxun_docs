### 1. Edit

Using this option, an existing robot's name or limit can be changed. A robot's limit is visible and can only be changed **if the robot performs a capture list action**.

### 2. Delete

An existing robot can be deleted only **if the robot does not have any associated runs**. For example, if a robot has been run 5 times in total, then these 5 runs would need to be deleted in order to delete the robot.

### 3. Duplicate 

A robot can be duplicated to extract data from pages **having the same structure**. Using duplication, a new robot need not be trained from scratch.
