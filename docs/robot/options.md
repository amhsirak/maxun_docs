## 2. Delete

An existing robot can be deleted only if the robot does not have any associated runs. For example, if a robot has 3 runs, all 3 runs must be deleted before the robot is deleted.

## 3. Duplicate 

A robot can be duplicated to extract data from pages **having the same structure**. Using duplication, a new robot need not be trained from scratch.
