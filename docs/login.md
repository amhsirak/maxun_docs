With Maxun, it is possible to extract data behind logins. All you need to do is enter your username/email and password!

## How to extract behind login?
1. Enter credentials while training the robot.
2. Perform an action to extract data. See supported robot actions here: <a href="/robot/robot-actions">Robot Actions.</a>
3. Credentials entered while robot training are securely encrypted and stored for future logins.
4. For each run, the robot will enter the stored credentials and login to perform the action specified.
