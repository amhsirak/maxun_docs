# i18n translation

Maxun supports 5+ languages now! Follow this guide to add your own languages (we LOVE community contributions)!

### Add a new language
1. Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun/tree/develop/public/locales">public/locales</a> directory.

2. Create your own language file (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish) in the <a href="https://github.com/getmaxun/maxun/tree/develop/public/locales">public/locales</a> directory.

3. Update the content of the file to include translations for your platform.

4. Open a pull request to `develop` branch.
