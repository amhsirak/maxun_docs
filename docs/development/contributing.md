## Open Your First Pull Request

### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch from the develop branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/new-feature` or `fix/bug-fix`. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of the changes.


### 2. Make your changes

Make the necessary code changes and commit them to your local branch.

Follow Conventional Commits: Use the format `<type>(<scope>): <short description>[optional body][optional footer]` for your commit messages.

Example: `feat(api): Add new endpoint for user data`

### 3. Push your changes
Push your local branch to the remote repository:
```git push origin <your-branch-name>```


### 4. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the repository on GitHub and navigate to the `Pull Requests` tab.
2. Click `New pull request`.
3. Select your branch as the "compare" branch and develop as the "base" branch.
4. Give your PR a descriptive title that summarizes the changes.
5. Write a clear and concise description of the changes you made and why they are necessary.
6. Add any relevant screenshots or GIFs to help visualize the changes.


### 5. Review and Merge

1. Once you submit the PR, it will be reviewed by other developers.
2. Address any comments or requested changes from the reviewers.
3. Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the develop branch.

### 6. Remember

1. Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting a PR.
2. Keep your PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix.
3. Be respectful and responsive to feedback from reviewers.
