# What is Maxun?

Maxun is a no-code platform for web data extraction. It lets users extract data from any website with a simple point-and-click interface. With Maxun, users can create no-code robots in 2 minutes to automate data extraction, turn websites to APIs and a lot more!

Maxun can be self-hosted or be accessed via Maxun Cloud (In Development).

## How Does It Work?

Maxun lets users creates custom robots that emulate user actions for automated data extraction. These robots can perform multiple capture actions to collect data.

## What Can A Robot Do?
1. Gather web data without writing a single line of code - just point, click, and collect
2. Handle infinite scrolling and pagination
3. Auto-adapt to website layout changes (coming soon)
4. Run on a specific schedule
5. Run via APIs for third-party integrations
6. Extract data behind login. 2FA/MFA support soon!
7. Integrate with your favorite applications. Google Sheet supported for now - more integrations coming soon!

... and much more!


## Robot Actions
Depending on the use-case, a robot should be configured to perform any of the following actions.

### 1. Capture List
